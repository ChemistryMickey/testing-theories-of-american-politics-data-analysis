    "- Paper figures partially replicable despite missing data \n",
    "- Those figure parts that can't be replicated are critical to the central argument of economic influence on policy adoption\n",
    "- Strong policy preference correlation (>= 0.85) among all economic classes\n",
    "- If a large proportion of a group is in favor of a piece of legislation, it's more likely to be adopted\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats:\n",
    "- Not all data provided (1/3 datasets referenced provided (about 30% of the total dataset))\n",
    "- Data analysis methods insufficiently explained in the paper. Inability to replicate figures may be due to missing data or unexpected method of analysis."
